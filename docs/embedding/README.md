# Embedding

There are several ways of embedding static media in ActionScript 3 programs. Both ActionScript 3, MXML and CSS have a way of embedding static media.

- ActionScript 3 uses the `[Embed]` meta data either in classes or variables.
- CSS uses the `Embed()` function.
- CSS uses `@font-face` statements that embed a local or system font.
