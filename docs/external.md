# External mode

Verification may occur in the *external* mode, where all methods must be either `abstract` or `native` and action statements and static media embedding are not allowed. In the external mode, no bytecode or SWF symbols are generated.

The external mode is used primarily for the framework built-in programming interface, such as Adobe AIR globals.
